# Component 4 - Symbol Table

A C++ program that creates a symbol table (a linked list) of all the defined variables (including their type and scope) and the names of all functions and procedures in an input file. Functions and procedures that have an input parameter list of variables and types will also be added (with appropriate scope) to the symbol table. Lastly, functions have a return datatype which will be noted in the symbol table as well.
